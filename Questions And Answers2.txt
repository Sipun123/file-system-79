Q.1)Who is responsible for Servlet's creation,execution and destruction?

A:- Servlet Container is responsible for Servlet's creation,execution and destruction.

Q.2)How Servlet container and web server process a request?

A:- i)Web server receives HTTP request from the User/client.
   ii)Web server forwards the request to servlet container.
   iii)The servlet is dynamically retrieved and loaded into the address space of the container, if it is not in the container.
   iv)The container invokes the init() method of the servlet for initialization(invoked once when the servlet is loaded first time).
   v)The container invokes the service() method of the servlet to process the HTTP request, i.e., read data in the request and formulate a response. 
    The servlet remains in the container's address space and can process other HTTP requests.
   vi)Web server return the dynamically generated results to the correct location.
   
Q.3)Any methods exist in servlet life cycle?
A:-Yes, there are three methods in Servlet life cycle.
   These are:init() method
             service() method
              destroy() method.
			  In it’s life cycle, the Servlet should exist in one of these three methods.
			  These methods are callback methods called automatically by Servlet container.
			  
Q.4)How to Retrieve Data from ServletConfig Interface Object?	
		  
A:-   ServletContext provide these 2 methods, In order to retrieve the data from the web..xml .
   These are--                  public String getInitParameter(“param name”);
                                And  public Enumeration getInitParameterNames();
Q.5)What is ServletContext in java?

A:- i)ServletContext is one of pre-defined interface available in javax.servlet package   .

    ii)Object  of ServletContext interface is available one per web application.

     

 Q.6)What is ServletConfig?
 
 A:- i)ServletConfig is an interface from the javax.servlet package.
    ii)For each Servlet under execution, a ServletConfig object is created by the servlet container and is used by the programmer to read the servlet specific data declared in the web.xml.
	
 Q.7)What is  the important job of HttpServletRequest interface?
 
A:- HttpServletRequest interface adds the methods that relates to the HTTP protocol. 

Q.8)What is  Servlet Response?

A:- Servlet API provides two important interfaces ServletResponse and HttpServletResponse to assist in sending response to client.
 
Q.9)What is  HTTPServlet Response Interface ? 

 A:- HTTPServlet Response Interface   adds the methods that relates to the HTTP response.

Q.10)What is  Request Dispatcher?

 A:-RequestDispatcher is an interface, implementation of which defines an object which can dispatch request to any resources(such as HTML, Image, JSP, Servlet) on the server.
 
 Q.11) What are the Various methods of Request Dispatcher?
 
A:- There are two different methods of Request Dispatcher; these are : void forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) and void include(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response).

Q.12) What is the work of sendRedirect() Method?

A:-sendRedirect() method redirects the response to another resource.
 This method actually makes the client(browser) to create a new request to get to the resource. 
  The client can see the new url in the browser.

Q.13)What is the main differnce between RequestDispatcher() and sendRedirect () ?
  
  A:-i)The main difference between a redirection and a request dispatching is that, redirection makes the client(browser) create a new request to get to the resource, the user can see the new URL while request dispatch get the resource in same request and URL does not changes.
     ii)Another very important difference is that, sendRedirect() works on response object while request dispatcher work on request object.
	 
Q.14) What is an Attribute?

A:-i)An attribute is an object that is used to share information in a web app. 
    ii)Attribute allows Servlets to share information among themselves.
	iii) Attributes can be SET and GET from one of the following scopes : Request,Session and Application.
	
Q.15)What is the method used to set an Attribute?

A:- public void setAttribute(String name,Object obj) methopd is used to set an Attribute.
